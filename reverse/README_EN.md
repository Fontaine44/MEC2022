# Pr√© CQI 2023 - Reverse Enginnering - 10 pts

# Context
Security is an essential aspect to all public facing programs. A compay that takes secutiry seriously will test their systems against attacks. This challenge will evaluate your capacities to test the security of such a system. You will have to exploit an executable in order to extract a flag with the given fotmat: `flag-012345678901`. You will be provided a portion of the code that makes up the executable.


## Required Software

* The given executable is for linux, therefore, you will need a computer with linux or a virtual machine with linux.
* We strongly suggest to use a reverse engineering tool such as the following:
  * Radare2
  * Binary Ninja
  * IDA
  * Ghidra

## Delivery

You will have to deliver the flag and a bash script demonstating your exploit.

## Instructions

You will have to exploit the `binary-with-flag` executable by giving it a specially crafted username and passord.
