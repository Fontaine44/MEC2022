# Pré CQI - Pre QEC 2023

## Scenario
Your company responds to a call for tenders published by a festival: Potato Cloud Fest. They are looking for a company that will be able to do contract development for an innovative application. Like many festivals these days, Potato Cloud Fest will welcome thousands of festival-goers who expect an enjoyable experience worth the cost of the entrance pass. It is therefore important that the systems used in all sections of the site are robust, and that technical glitches are dealt with effectively. 

In the call for tenders, it is stated that the festival would like to interview all the companies that responded. 

Your company does not want to lose this client, because it could open doors for them in the festival industry. This is why a team with the best assets of the company is being built. It seems that your analytical and problem-solving skills are exactly what the company needs to make sure the interview goes smoothly. 

The employer specifies in the call for tenders that the respondents will have to set up a team that masters different aspects of programming. It will therefore be very important to form a team comprising several experts in different fields of IT. To do this, the festival will provide you with a list of issues to solve to facilitate the interview process. 

Your mandate is to solve the greatest number of problems in a given amount of time and accumulate a better score than your competitors.
