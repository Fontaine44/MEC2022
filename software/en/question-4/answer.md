# Pre-CQI - Software Engineering

## Answer 4 - Quantitative process analysis (3 points)

a) This is a disciplined life cycle for example waterfall, because there was much more time spent on implementation than on testing.

b) Since the software was not tested very much, there could be little risk mitigation strategies. If there are issues it will be hard to go back and fix them as this model does not account for changes in the requirements.

c) I would switch this project to use a more agile approach. We would discuss and test more often than work on the requirements, in order to quickly resolve the issue an make it easier to go back and make changes.
