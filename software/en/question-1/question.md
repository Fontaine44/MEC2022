e) The CEO of the PotatoFest web application would like to consider whether it is worth varying the GUI of the application based on the gender of the user. For example, he would like to experiment with different color schemes or with a different layout. To allow this to happen, the
PDG is hesitating between four modern deployment/release strategies, ie. the "Blue-Green", "Rolling", "Canary" and "A/B" strategies.

As a PotatoFest release engineer, make it clear to your CEO that it would be the best strategy to take among the four strategies.
