# Pre-CQI - Software Engineering

## Answer 1 - Software Development (2 points)

a) Option B
b) Unit testing is like white box testing where it is straightforward. You test small modules as you write your code. Integration testing is more complex, it is known as black box testing where you test two or more programs together. This makes it more slow and difficult to run and find errors. Regression testing is just going back after youve added code and testing to make sure everything still works fine. I wouldn't say that unit testing and integration testing ARE regression tests but rather these tests could be used to perfrom regression tests.
c) IaaS is a third party that provides cloud storage but the OS and data is all managed by the user. An example of this is google cloud. PaaS allows you to write your code to build your apps/programs without having to deal with the maintenance of the platform. An example of this is Windows Azure. And lastly SaaS is an application service that is fully managed by the provider. This is the case for most applications, an example being Slack. 
d) Both asCode operations allow for easy collaboration within teams. They also allow for all older versions of code to be accessible so you never lose any previous work you had. The difference between the two is that infrastructure is more known for cloud infrastructures whereas pipeline is like git. 
e) A/B testing is focused on testing multiple ideas. It tests different experiments in the same environment to provide the best outcome. This way the CEO can really test each which color scheme works best for his application.
