# Pre-QEC 2023 - Software Engineering (10 points)

## Scenario

You need to demonstrate to the Potato Cloud Fest organizers that you are a good software engineer. What is the difference between a software engineer and a computer engineer? The 1 Million question to which no one in this universe has managed to answer it without falling into a debate to either finish what is better between software engineering and computer engineering. It's finally time to put an end to this debate: Software Engineering is the winner of course.

It's time to show to computer engineering the chasm that separates us!! For this you will have to answer theoretical questions.

## Precision

Questions are found in `question-<#>` folders and each folder has a `question.md` file and an `answer.md` file. You must fill in your answers in the `answer.md` file and include it in your submission.
